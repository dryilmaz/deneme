" Viktor Rydberg's Investigations into Germanic Mythology, Volume II, Part 1: Indo-European Mythology ",9780595679614,Hardcover,02/16/2007,iUniverse,English,"

In an area traditionally seen as primitive and barbaric, it would seem a complex religion had flourished more than 3,600 years ago. We have been dramatically underestimating the prehistoric peoples, says Harald Meller, Head Archaeologist at the Museum of Halle in Saxony-Anhalt, where the Nebra disc was discovered. Scientists have long known that most Europeans languages stem from an older Proto-Indo-European root, perhaps originating in the Russian Steppes c. 4000-6000 BC. Many have speculated about the culture and the religion of its speakers, but few in as great detail as Viktor Rydberg. Here he illuminates Proto-Indo-European beliefs through a comparative analysis of its earliest religious texts, among them, the Rigveda, the Zend-Avesta, and the Icelandic Poetic and Prose Eddas, concluding with his own thoughts on mythological method. This, the second volume of Rydberg's two-volume Underskningar i Germanisk Mythologi, is the sequel to his Teutonic Mythology, Insightful research from the dawn of comparative mythological studies, these controversial essays remain as relevant today, as they were when they were published over a century ago. This is the first part of a two-part set.SynopsisSix 'new' essays on Norse mythology by the Swedish poet and scholar, Viktor Rydberg (1828-1895), translated into English for the first time. Representing half of the second volume of Rydberg's two-volume Undersö kningar i Germanisk Mythologi, this work includes: Later Germanic Myths, exploring aspects of their relationship to other Indo-European systems. Towards the Baldur Myth, an analysis of the proto Indo-European myth of the Divine Twins, and an investigation of Baldur and Hö dur's character in the North. Há rbarð sljó ð , a case for identifying the famous ferryman of the Eddaic lay with Thor's rival, the cunning Loki. Brisingamen's Smiths, an examination of the nature of dwarves in Norse mythology and folklore. An Overview of the Mythic Epic, a complete chronological outline of the mythic events preserved in the Eddas and elsewhere, based on Rydberg's comprehensive study of the Germanic source material.

Some of the biggest musical stars (and stars of the future) appeared in these films: Louis Armstrong, Spike Jones, Liberace, Fats Waller, Stan Kenton, Cab Calloway, and many others. Thanks to Soundies, hundreds of unique musical performances were photographed for posterity. These mini-musicals were originally nothing more than a ten-cent novelty. Today, to film and music fans, they're a priceless part of history. Scott MacGillivray and Ted Okuda, authors of the landmark resource book The Soundies Distributing Corporation of America, now offer this revised and expanded guide to the Soundies musicals. This all-new book picks up where the original left off: more than 1800 titles are classified by performer, title, and date-many with new, individual annotations and all with new cross-references for easy reading and consultation. There is also a historical account of the prolific Soundies production companies, a look at Soundies' many competitors and descendants (including telescriptions and Scopitones), a checklist of the dozens of Soundies home-movie editions, and a listing of alternate titles to help collectors identify the films more easily.

Some strategies and tactics appear extreme to a civilized country as the United States. However, we should know about and understand these strategies and tactics in case we must use them because the Isfasts are about to annihilate, conquer, or place us in bondage. I have quoted ideas from Sun Tzu, Gen. George S. Patton, Jr., and Dr. Michael Savage, a man of great intellect. Our Administration has made a major mistake by not learning from great warriors like Sun Tzu and Gen. Patton. Our Administration makes an even larger mistake by ignoring Michael Savage's thoughts, ideas, and suggestions. Many ideas are common sense, which seems to be lacking in our politicians, Administration, and military generals. Apparently, they do not know how to fight and win an asymmetrical war.

In today's game, fresh and unpredictable plays are crucial, so it's vital to pick your plays from a wide and creative arsenal. Sixteen-year-old Warren Erdmann provides just that for coaches everywhere. In My Motion Offense at 16, Erdmann has compiled an original array of offensive plays based on a philosophy of spreading out the defense, using the entire field, keeping the play-calling simple, making the defense adjust to the offense, and using the team's strengths to exploit the opponents' weaknesses. In explaining and diagramming each play, Erdmann clearly illustrates how to maximize the talent on the field and breaks down how a play capitalizes on the strengths of the offense and the weaknesses of the defense. In most of his plays, Erdmann emphasizes that seconds count, communication matters, and carefully orchestrating the eleven players on offense is critical to maximizing their talent and ultimately putting points on the scoreboard. This ambitious book constructively uses terminology and diagrams to describe each play and its execution for coaches, players, and devoted fans. You will be impressed that a high school junior has devised so many interesting plays and has organized them so well to make your team successful on the football field.",132,"Warren W., IV Erdmann"

However, he didn't know that during his term of office a dispute between the rabbi and the temple's major financial contributor would develop and threaten the very life of the temple. And while this may be the most obvious problem, there are others also: leaking roofs, local anti-Semitism and a congregation divided among those who are over zealous and those who simply don't care. The president seeks to deal with all these issues while struggling with his own problems and personal conflicts. While keeping a sense of humor, he goes about the business of handling all the challenges and personalities that confront him. Yet, he is not immune to self doubt and at times wonders if God really cares about his little temple. The Temple President blends a healthy dose of laughter with the serious questions about the nature of God, anti-Semitism, and religious traditions.

As President Benito Jurez suspends payment of Mexico's foreign debts, the French drop their faade of debt negotiations and head for Puebla, where they are soundly defeated in their attempt to capture the city. The French withdraw from their stunning setback and spend the summer of 1862 nursing their wounds and awaiting reinforcements in Orizaba.

$29.50",https://covers.powells.com/9780595894307.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsThe journey of life from birth to death is a phenomenon that is common to all human beings. It's an experience that transcends all the variables of our existence such as race, religion and nationality. How we reach our destination, accomplish our goals and realize our God-given destiny is contingent upon our ability to navigate the contours of that journey. We can indeed celebrate the blessings and successes, confront the obstacles and cope with the myriad experiences of life's journey. This book is addressed to all who struggle to meet the challenges of life's journey. Some chapters provide us with powerful and compelling stories of those who in the face of adversity and disappointment did not retreat nor surrender but who through faith, determination, patience and indefatigable will were able to triumph over the troubles, trials, temptation and tribulation of their experience. Other chapters provide the reader with stories that serve as sign posts that allow one to make the appropriate detours and diversions in order to avoid the pitfalls and potholes of life's journey. The content of this book provides us not only with a road map, but also with some valuable tools for our survival kit as we traverse the diverse landscape of that journey.",176,Henderson Brome

 Another Day in Lincoln's Army: The Civil War Journals of Sgt. John T. Booth ,9780595898343,Hardcover,04/23/2007,iUniverse,English,"

$55.50",https://covers.powells.com/9780595898343.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsSynopsisIn the introduction of his diary, Sgt. John T. Booth of Company G, 36th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, writes that the experience of a single soldier can never be considered a history of the conflict in which the soldier serves, but merely a reflection of his personal experience. Another Day in Lincoln's Army: The Civil War Journals of Sgt. John T. Booth brilliantly illustrates this concept, capturing the ordinary day-to-day life of the Civil War soldier.  From Western Virginia and Antietam Creek in Maryland to Chickamauga in the Tennessee mountains, this is the compelling story of Booth and the 36th Ohio Volunteer Infantry (OVI) in the American Civil War. One of only a few regiments privileged to have served in both the eastern and western theatres of the conflict, the 36th OVI fought in some of the bloodiest battles of the war. Booth eloquently journals the striking contrast between the often mundane activities of camp life and the horrifying sequences of battle. Edited and compiled by Marie Mollohan, Another Day in Lincoln's Army also includes photographs of soldiers who served alongside Booth, letters and diary entries from other soldiers in the 36th OVI, and a mixture of feature stories from period newspapers, vividly bringing this extraordinary time in America's history to life.",724,Marie Mollohan

$26.50",https://covers.powells.com/9780595916986.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsLetter writing would seem to be a lost art today, but in the 1880's and 1890's, the young people of Greenbrier County, West Virginia found much pleasure in exchanging personal correspondence. In West Virginia, public education began only after the end of the Civil War, and these people were enthusiastically using their new writing skills. Janie Lewis, born in Grassy Meadows, Greenbrier County in 1873, saved the letters that she received in her youth, which have been passed down in her family to the present generation. They offer a fascinating account of a changing period in West Virginia history. While strong family ties were evidently important, the young people of Greenbrier were branching out in new directions. Some were pursuing higher education and careers in teaching. Others were lured into the new mining and construction industries, leaving the traditional family farming life. And, of course, romance plays a prominent role in their affairs. Janie received many touching and ardent letters from her suitors. These letters are a wonderful historical artifact that will transport the reader to another time and place.",116,Roy C. Ritter III

$33.95",https://covers.powells.com/9780595917785.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsSynopsisHillary Is the Best Choice presents a more balanced view of politics. To start with, politics is neither good nor bad. It is neutral. It can either go good or bad depending on the politicians who are involved. For the first time in American presidential politics, for example, we have a woman candidate. In previous elections, when only men were presidential contenders, the tendency to play dirty was always a great temptation. With Hillary Clinton, Democratic Senator from New York and our country's former First Lady, as one of the current leading presidential aspirants, it is our hope that the old pattern of negativity will be replaced by a new pattern of political civility. Politics can be a clean activity. And elections, especially presidential ones, ought to be a matter of choosing the better of two goods (when an independent or third party candidate is running, it will be a matter of choosing the best of three).",244,Fremont Ca Catherine L.

$18.95",https://covers.powells.com/9780596002053.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsXML is a text-based markup language that has taken the programming world by storm. More powerful than HTML yet less demanding than SGML, XML has proven itself to be flexible and resilient. XML is the perfect tool for formatting documents with even the smallest bit of complexity, from Web pages to legal contracts to books. However, XML has also proven itself to be indispensable for organizing and conveying other sorts of data as well, thus its central role in web services like SOAP and XML-RPC. 

As the Perl programming language was tailor-made for manipulating text, few people have disputed the fact that Perl and XML are perfectly suited for one another. The only question has been what's the best way to do it. That's where this book comes in. 

Perl & XML is aimed at Perl programmers who need to work with XML documents and data. The book covers all the major modules for XML processing in Perl, including XML::Simple, XML::Parser, XML::LibXML, XML::XPath, XML::Writer, XML::Pyx, XML::Parser::PerlSAX, XML::SAX, XML::SimpleObject, XML::TreeBuilder, XML::Grove, XML::DOM, XML::RSS, XML::Generator::DBI, and SOAP::Lite. But this book is more than just a listing of modules; it gives a complete, comprehensive tour of the landscape of Perl and XML, making sense of the myriad of modules, terminology, and techniques. 
This book covers: 





parsing XML documents and writing them out again 

working with event streams and SAX 

tree processing and the Document Object Model 

advanced tree processing with XPath and XSLT 


Most valuably, the last two chapters of Perl & XML give complete examples of XML applications, pulling together all the tools at your disposal. All together, Perl & XML is the single book that gives you a solid grounding in XML processing with Perl.

 Oracle In Nutshell ,9780596003364,Trade Paperback,12/28/2002,OREILLY & ASSOCIATES INC,no language,"

$9.50",https://powells-covers-2.s3.amazonaws.com/9780596003364.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsIntroduced a quarter-century ago, the Oracle database remains the leading enterprise relational database management system (RDBMS) in the world. Oracle is a complex system, offering a myriad of products, languages, and tools. Frequent updates, releases, and editions complicate the ability of Oracle users to keep up with the huge amounts of frequently changing information about the database and its capabilities. 

The goal of Oracle in a Nutshell is to pull together the most essential information on Oracle architecture, syntax, and user interfaces. The content and format of this book, an admirable addition to O'Reilly's respected In-a-Nutshell line, combine to boil down vital Oracle commands, language constructs, parameters, and file formats in a succinct and highly accessible desktop reference. 
Oracle in a Nutshell covers the information that database administrators PL/SQL and Java developers, and system, network, and security administrators need as they manage Oracle databases and write code for these databases. It includes:


Oracle Foundations  Overview of the Oracle architecture (memory structures and fundamental concepts), Oracle's various editions and packaging options, summary of the initialization file parameters and data dictionary views, and fundamentals of Oracle's concurrency scheme, security mechanisms (privileges, profiles, roles), and networking files (TNSNAMES.ORA, SQLNET.ORA, LISTENER.ORA, DAP.ORA, NAMES.ORA, CMAN.ORA) and options.

Oracle Languages  Syntax summary for SQL language statements, SQL function calls PL/SQL language statements and characteristics, PL/SQL built-in package headers, and Java (JDBC and SQLJ) interfaces to the Oracle database.

Oracle Tools  Commands provided with SQL*Plus, SQL*Loader, Import and Export, Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) and other backup/recovery methods, Oracle Enterprise Manager, and various performance tuning tools (Explain Plan, TKPROF, AUTOTRACE, UTLBSTAT, UTLESTAT, Statspack).

Appendixes  Summary of Oracle datatypes, operators, expressions, conditions, numeric and date formats, and resources for additional reading.

In Linux and other forms of UNIX, a man page is online help. The Linux online manual accessed by simple man commands provides as much information with more detail. Also, the O'Reilly book does not reference any of the Red Hat administration tools. This is because the O'Reilly book is a UNIX and Linux general text, rather than specifically Red Hat.

Callie secretly decides to make the day-trip.After a gas-pump ""run-in"" leads to a coffee shop conversation, the two embark on a weekend of emotional and humorous remembrance. These conversations lead to additional confessions, apologies, truths and lies as interjections from Callie's family, Jason's child, and new beach friends to help and impede confronting their past, present and future plans with all their wants, baggage and family concerns.",236,Jeffrey Curry

$9.50",https://covers.powells.com/9780596004781.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsPerl is a versatile, powerful programming language used in a variety of disciplines, ranging from system administration to web programming to database manipulation. One slogan of Perl is that it makes easy things easy and hard things possible. This book is about making the leap from the easy things to the hard ones.

Learning Perl Objects, References & Modules offers a gentle but thorough introduction to advanced programming in Perl. Written by the authors of the best-selling Learning Perl, this book picks up where that book left off. 
Topics include: 

Packages and namespaces 
References and scoping 
Manipulating complex data structures 
Object-oriented programming 
Writing and using modules 
Contributing to CPAN 

Following the successful format of Learning Perl, each chapter in the book is designed to be small enough to be read in just an hour or two, ending with a series of exercises to help you practice what you've learned. To use the book, you just need to be familiar with the material in Learning Perl and have ambition to go further. 

Perl is a different language to different people. It is a quick scripting tool for some, and a fully-featured object-oriented language for others. It is used for everything from performing quick global replacements on text files, to crunching huge, complex sets of scientific data that take weeks to process. Perl is what you make of it. But regardless of what you use Perl for, this book helps you do it more effectively, efficiently, and elegantly. 

Learning Perl Objects, References & Modules is about learning to use Perl as a programming language, and not just a scripting language. This is the book that separates the Perl dabbler from the Perl programmer.

About the AuthorRandal L. Schwartz is a two-decade veteran of the software industry. He is skilled in software design, system administration, security, technical writing, and training. Randal has coauthored the ""must-have"" standards: Programming Perl, Learning Perl, Learning Perl for Win32 Systems, and Effective Perl Learning, and is a regular columnist for WebTechniques, PerformanceComputing, SysAdmin, and Linux magazines. He is also a frequent contributor to the Perl newsgroups, and has moderated comp.lang.perl.announce since its inception. His offbeat humor and technical mastery have reached legendary proportions worldwide (but he probably started some of those legends himself). Randal's desire to give back to the Perl community inspired him to help create and provide initial funding for The Perl Institute. He is also a founding board member of the Perl Mongers (perl.org), the worldwide Perl grassroots advocacy organization. Since 1985, Randal has owned and operated Stonehenge Consulting Services, Inc. Randal can be reached for comment at merlyn@stonehenge.com or (503) 777-0095, and welcomes questions on Perl and other related topics.Tom Phoenix has been working in the field of education since 1982. After more than thirteen years of dissections, explosions, work with interesting animals, and high-voltage sparks during his work at a science museum, he started teaching Perl classes for Stonehenge Consulting Services, where he's worked since 1996. Since then, he has traveled to many interesting locations, so you might see him soon at a Perl Mongers' meeting. When he has time, he answers questions on Usenet's comp.lang.perl.misc and comp.lang.perl.moderated newsgroups, and contributes to the development and usefulness of Perl. Besides his work with Perl, Perl hackers, and related topics, Tom spends his time on amateur cryptography and speaking Esperanto. His home is in Portland, Oregon.Table of ContentsForeword; Preface; Structure of This Book; Conventions Used in This Book; Comments and Questions; Acknowledgments; Chapter 1: Introduction; 1.1 What Should You Know Already?;

$59.99",https://covers.powells.com/9780596004927.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsAdopted as the undisputed Perl bible soon after the first edition appeared in 1991, Programming Perl is still the go-to guide for this highly practical language. Perl began life as a super-fueled text processing utility, but quickly evolved into a general purpose programming language thats helped hundreds of thousands of programmers, system administrators, and enthusiasts, like you, get your job done.In this much-anticipated update to ""the Camel,"" three renowned Perl authors cover the language up to its current version, Perl 5.14, with a preview of features in the upcoming 5.16. In a world where Unicode is increasingly essential for text processing, Perl offers the best and least painful support of any major language, smoothly integrating Unicode everywhere—including in Perls most popular feature: regular expressions.Important features covered by this update include:New keywords and syntaxI/O layers and encodingsNew backslash escapesUnicode 6.0Unicode grapheme clusters and propertiesNamed captures in regexesRecursive and grammatical patternsExpanded coverage of CPANCurrent best practicesSynopsisWhen it comes to learning Perl, programmers consider this book to be the undisputed bible. You not only learn every nuance of this language, you also get a unique perspective on the evolution of Perl and its future direction. The 4th edition has been thoroughly updated for version 5.14, with details on regular expressions, support for UNICODE, threads, and many other features.Many Perl books explain typeglobs, pseudohashes, and closures, but only this one shows the motivations behind these features and why they work the way they do. It's exactly what you'd expect from its prominent authors: Larry Wall is the inventor of Perl, and Tom Christiansen was one of the first champions of the language. In print since 1991, the book affectionately known as ""the Camel"" has played a central role in computing among programmers and system administrators around the world. With Programming Perl, you too will learn the most efficient ways to use this language.About the AuthorTom Christiansen is a freelance consultant specializing in Perl training and writing. After working for several years for TSR Hobbies (of Dungeons and Dragons fame), he set off for college where he spent a year in Spain and five in America, dabbling in music, linguistics, programming, and some half-dozen differentspoken languages. Tom finally escaped UW-Madison with undergraduate degrees in Spanish and computer science and a graduate degree in computer science. He then spent five years at Convex as a jack-of-all-trades working on everything from system administration to utility and kernel development, withcustomer support and training thrown in for good measure. Tom also served two terms on the USENIX Association Board of directors. With over thirty years' experience in Unix systems programming, Tom presents seminars internationally. Living in the foothills above Boulder, Colorado, Tom takes summers off for hiking, hacking, birding, music making, and gaming.brian d foy is a prolific Perl trainer and writer, and runs The Perl Review to help people use and understand Perl through educational, consulting, code review, and more. He's a frequent speaker at Perl conferences. He's the coauthor of Learning Perl, Intermediate Perl, and Effective Perl Programming, and the author of Mastering Perl. He was an instructor and author for Stonehenge Consulting Services from 1998 to 2009, a Perl user since he was a physics graduate student, and a die-hard Mac user since he first owned a computer. He founded the first Perl user group, the New York Perl Mongers, as well as the Perl advocacy nonprofit Perl Mongers, Inc., which helped form more than 200 Perl user groups across the globe. He maintains the perlfaq portions of the core Perl documentation, several modules on CPAN, and some standalone scripts.Larry Wall originally created Perl while a programmer at Unisys. He now works full time guiding the future development of the language. Larry is known for his idiosyncratic and thought-provoking approach to programming, as well as for his groundbreaking contributions to the culture of free software programming.Jon Orwant founded The Perl Journal and received the White Camel lifetime achievement award for contributions to Perl in 2004. He's Engineering Manager at Google, where he leads Patent Search, visualizations, and digital humanities teams. For most of his tenure at Google, Jon worked on Book Search, and he developed the widely used Google Books Ngram Viewer. Prior to Google, he wasCTO of O'Reilly, Director of Research at France Telecom, and a Lecturer at MIT. Orwant received his doctorate from MIT's Electronic Publishing Group in 1999.Table of ContentsPreface; The Pursuit of Happiness; What's New in This Edition; The Standard Distribution; Online Documentation;

But, if you are a network administrator chances are you're under increasing pressure to ensure that mission-critical systems are safe--in fact impenetrable--from malicious code, buffer overflows, stealth port scans, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, CGI attacks, and other network intruders.Designing a reliable way to detect intruders before they get in is a vital but daunting challenge. Because of this, a plethora of complex, sophisticated, and pricy software solutions are now available. In terms of raw power and features, SNORT, the most commonly used Open Source Intrusion Detection System, (IDS) has begun to eclipse many expensive proprietary IDSes. In terms of documentation or ease of use, however, SNORT can seem overwhelming. Which output plugin to use? How do you to email alerts to yourself? Most importantly, how do you sort through the immense amount of information Snort makes available to you?Many intrusion detection books are long on theory but short on specifics and practical examples. Not Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools. This new book is a thorough, exceptionally practical guide to managing network security using Snort 2.1 (the latest release) and dozens of other high-quality open source other open source intrusion detection programs.Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools covers reliable methods for detecting network intruders, from using simple packet sniffers to more sophisticated IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) applications and the GUI interfaces for managing them. A comprehensive but concise guide for monitoring illegal entry attempts, this invaluable new book explains how to shut down and secure workstations, servers, firewalls, routers, sensors and other network devices.Step-by-step instructions are provided to quickly get up and running with Snort. Each chapter includes links for the programs discussed, and additional links at the end of the book give administrators access to numerous web sites for additional information and instructional material that will satisfy even the most serious security enthusiasts.Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools maps out a proactive--and effective--approach to keeping your systems safe from attack.SynopsisMany intrusion detection books are long on theory but short on specifics and practical examples.

If you're ready for one of your own, Microsoft's FrontPage 2003 has everything you need to create Web pages. It's true. Your geek friends may howl in contempt if you use FrontPage, but that's because the program has a reputation for spitting out cookie-cutter Web pages with messy, overloaded HTML code that takes forever to load. Not any more.After listening to complaints, Microsoft has given FrontPage 2003 some pretty advanced features, including an HTML cleanup tool that helps alleviate bloated code, and new support for Macromedia Flash and XML. Now, savvy Web veterans can control as much of the process as they want, and even collaborate on a site with developers who use Dreamweaver, GoLive or other Web authoring tools. Yet, unlike those other tools, FrontPage 2003 still has automated features for beginners who don't know where to start. There's still one flaw, though. Microsoft's idea of a user manual is a flimsy pamphlet. But that's easily solved. FrontPage 2003: The Missing Manual offers you everything from the basics to meaty sections on advanced tasks. Our book puts the program's features in context, with clear and thorough chapters that provide valuable shortcuts, workarounds, and just plain common sense, no matter where you weigh in on the technical scale. With it, you can learn to build simple Web pages, or sophisticated ones with tables and Cascading Style Sheets, and find out how to manage and publish a Web site. You'll also learn to create forms, work with databases, and integrate FrontPage with Microsoft Office.If you haven't worked with Web pages before, each chapter provides ""Up to Speed"" sidebars with useful background information.

Whether you're creating a desktop application or an enterprise system, complexity is the big hairy monster you must manage.The Unified Modeling Language (UML) helps you manage this complexity. Whether you're looking to use UML as a blueprint language, a sketch tool, or as a programming language, this book will give you the need-to-know information on how to apply UML to your project. While there are plenty of books available that describe UML, Learning UML 2.0 will show you how to use it. Topics covered include:Capturing your system's requirements in your model to help you ensure that your designs meet your users' needsModeling the parts of your system and their relationshipsModeling how the parts of your system work together to meet your system's requirementsModeling how your system moves into the real world, capturing how your system will be deployedEngaging and accessible, this book shows you how to use UML to craft and communicate your project's design. Russ Miles and Kim Hamilton have written a pragmatic introduction to UML based on hard-earned practice, not theory. Regardless of the software process or methodology you use, this book is the one source you need to get up and running with UML 2.0.Russ Miles is a software engineer for General Dynamics UK, where he works with Java and Distributed Systems, although his passion at the moment is Aspect Orientation and, in particular, AspectJ.

$28.00",https://covers.powells.com/9780596514822.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsDo you want to learn C#? Programmers around the world have learned that C# lets them design great-looking programs and build them fast. With C#, you ve got a powerful programming language and a valuable tool at your fingertips. And with the Visual Studio IDE, you ll never have to spend hours writing obscure code just to get a button working. C#, Visual Studio and .NET take care of the grunt-work, and let you focus on the interesting parts of getting your programs written. Sound appealing?  Unlike other C# books, which just show you examples and expect you to just memorize them and move on, Head First C# gets you writing code from the beginning. You're given the tools you need, and then you're guided through fun and engaging programming projects. You'll build programs to play a card game, explore a house, and help lazy programmers manage their sick day excuses. But it's not all fun and games: you'll build business applications too, like a contact database and a program to help a party planner estimate her dinner parties. You'll build a dungeon role-playing game and a fully animated, colorful simulation of a beehive. And by the end of the book, you'll build a fast-paced, full-featured retro Invaders arcade game.  Make no mistake: by the time you're done with Head First C#, you'll be able to build full-scale, complex, and highly visual programs. And you'll have all of the C# tools you need to tackle almost any programming problem that comes your way.  Head First C# is built for your brain, using the revolutionary approach that was pioneered by the highly acclaimed and popular Head First series. You'll never get that bored, eyes glazed over feeling from Head First C#, because it guides you through one challenging project after another until, by the end of the book, you're a C# rock star   Here's what you'll learn: Core C# programming concepts How to use the Visual Studio 2008 IDE to build, debug and run your programs Important .NET 3.5 features, including generic collections, Windows forms, GDI+ graphics, streams, serialization and more Using object oriented programming concepts to help you build well-designed programs How to build robust applications with good error handling The latest C# 3.0 features, including LINQ, object and collection initializers, automatic properties, extension methods and more  Throughout the book, you'll confront and conquer advanced C# concepts. Some of the most mysterious ideas are demystified and explained with clear examples: how Unicode works, events and delegates, references versus value types, the stack versus the heap, what's really going on with garbage collection, and more.  Thousands of readers have learned C# using this innovative book, including: Beginning programmers who want to learn programming from the ground up More advanced programmers who are proficient in another language (like Visual Basic, Java, SQL, FoxPro) and want to add C# to their toolbox Programmers who understand basic C# syntax, but are still looking to get a handle on how objects work Anyone who's tried to learn C#, but had to deal with books full of dull examples and nothing but boring console applications Lots of people who just want to learn how to build cool games   Head First C# is built to work with any version of Visual Studio 2008, including the free express edition. (It can also can be used with any version of Visual Studio 2005.)SynopsisYou want to learn C# programming stuff don't you? Everyone's doing it. Come on, it'll be fun. No, really, it will be fun... Oh, you're thinking this is another mind-numbingly dry technical book that will bore you to tears. We know you've suffered through tedious technical books before. This is not one of those books. We'll take you on a journey and show you C# in a way that it's never been seen before, from creating your first program, to learning better C# coding skills to avoid the common errors that besiege students learning a new language. From objects to garbage (collection that is), and from errors to interactions, we'll show you the ins-and-outs of C# to engage and entertain your brain.SynopsisHead First C# is a complete learning experience for object-oriented programming, C#, and the Visual Studio IDE. Built for your brain, this book covers C# 3.0 and Visual Studio 2008, and teaches everything from language fundamentals to advanced topics including garbage collection, extension methods, and double-buffered animation. You'll also master C#'s hottest and newest syntax, LINQ, for querying SQL databases, .NET collections, and XML documents. By the time you're through, you'll be a proficient C# programmer, designing and coding large-scale applications.Every few chapters you will come across a lab that lets you apply what you've learned up to that point. Each lab is designed to simulate a professional programming task, increasing in complexity until-at last-you build a working Invaders game, complete with shooting ships, aliens descending while firing, and an animated death sequence for unlucky starfighters. This remarkably engaging book will have you going from zero to 60 with C# in no time flat.About the AuthorAndrew, despite being raised a New Yorker, has lived in Minneapolis, Geneva, and Pittsburgh... twice. The first time was when he graduated from Carnegie Mellons School of Computer Science, and then again when he and Jenny were starting their consulting business and writing their first book for OReilly. He and Jenny first worked together at a company on Wall Street that built financial software, where he was managing a team of programmers. Over the years hes been a Vice President at a major investment bank, architected large-scale real-time back end systems, managed large international software teams, and consulted for companies, schools, and organizations, including Microsoft, the National Bureau of Economic Research, and MIT. Hes had the privilege working with some pretty amazing programmers during that time, and likes to think that hes learned a few things from them.Bestselling O'Reilly authors Jennifer Greene and Andrew Stellman have been building software and writing about software engineering together since they first met in 1998. Their first book, Applied Software Project Management, was published by OReilly in 2005. Other Stellman and Greene books for OReilly include Beautiful Teams (2009), and their first book in the Head First series, Head First PMP (2007). They founded Stellman & Greene Consulting in 2003 to build a really neat software project for scientists studying herbicide exposure in Vietnam vets. In addition to building software and writing books, theyve provided training and consulted for companies and spoken at conferences and meetings of software engineers, architects and project managers.  Jenny studied philosophy in college but, like everyone else in the field, couldnt find a job doing it. Luckily, shes a great software engineer, so she started out working at an online service, and thats the first time she really got a good sense of what good software development looked like. She moved to New York in 1998 to work on software quality at a financial software company. Shes managed a teams of developers, testers and PMs on software projects in media and finance since then. Shes traveled all over the world to work with different software teams and build all kinds of cool projects.Table of Contents; Advance Praise for Head First C#; Praise for other Head First books; ; How to Use this Book: Intro; Who is this book for?; Who should probably back away from this book?; We know what you're thinking.; And we know what your brain is thinking.; Metacognition: thinking about thinking; Here's what WE did:; Here's what YOU can do to bend your brain into submission; What you need for this book:; Read me; The technical review team; Acknowledgments; Safari® Books Online; Chapter 1: Get Productive With c#: Visual Applications, in 10 minutes or less; 1.1 Why you should learn C#; 1.2 C# and the Visual Studio IDE make lots of things easy; 1.3 Help the CEO go paperless; 1.4 Get to know your users' needs before you start building your program; 1.5 Here's what you're going to build; 1.6 What you do in Visual Studio...; 1.7 What Visual Studio does for you...; 1.8 Develop the user interface; 1.9 Visual Studio, behind the scenes; 1.10 Add to the auto-generated code; 1.11 You can already run your application; 1.12 Where are my files?; 1.13 Here's what we've done so far; 1.14 We need a database to store our information; 1.15 The IDE created a database; 1.16 SQL is its own language; 1.17 Creating the table for the Contact List; 1.18 The blanks on contact card are columns in our People table; 1.19 Finish building the table; 1.20 Diagram your data; 1.21 Insert your card data into the database; 1.22 Connect your form to your database objects with a data source; 1.23 Add database-driven controls to your form; 1.24 Good programs are intuitive to use; 1.25 Test drive; 1.26 How to turn YOUR application into EVERYONE'S application; 1.27 Give your users the application; 1.28 You built a complete data-driven application; 1.29 You built a complete data-driven application; 1.30 CSharpcross; 1.31 CSharpcross Solution; Chapter 2: It's All Just Code: Under the Hood; 2.1 When you're doing this...; 2.2 ...the IDE does this; 2.3 Where programs come from; 2.4 The IDE helps you code; 2.5 When you change things in the IDE, you're also changing your code; 2.6 Anatomy of a program; 2.7 Your program knows where to start; 2.8 You can change your program's entry point; 2.9 Two classes can be in the same namespace; 2.10 Your programs use variables to work with data; 2.11 C# uses familiar math symbols; 2.12 Loops perform an action over and over again; 2.13 Time to start coding; 2.14 if/else statements make decisions; 2.15 Set up conditions and see if they're true; 2.16 Csharpcross; 2.17 Csharpcross Solution; Chapter 3: Objects: Get Oriented!: Making Code Make Sense; 3.1 How Mike thinks about his problems; 3.2 How Mike's car navigation system thinks about his problems; 3.3 Mike's Navigator class has methods to set and modify routes; 3.4 Use what you've learned to build a simple application; 3.5 Mike gets an idea; 3.6 Mike can use objects to solve his problem; 3.7 You use a class to build an object; 3.8 When you create a new object from a class, it's called an instance of that class.; 3.9 A better solution... brought to you by objects!; 3.10 An instance uses fields to keep track of things; 3.11 Let's create some instances!; 3.12 Thanks for the memory; 3.13 What's on your program's mind; 3.14 You can use class and method names to make your code intuitive; 3.15 Give your classes a natural structure; 3.16 Class diagrams help you organize your classes so they make sense; 3.17 Build a class to work with some guys; 3.18 Create a project for your guys; 3.19 Build a form to interact with the guys; 3.20 There's an even easier way to initialize objects; 3.21 A few ideas for designing intuitive classes; 3.22 Objectcross; 3.23 Objectcross Solution; Chapter 4: Types and References: It's 10:00.

$39.99",https://covers.powells.com/9780596514839.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsMillions of dollars are spent every year developing, testing, defending, and fixing web applications -- and, ultimately, web developers are blamed when something goes wrong. Web Security Testing Cookbook gives developers an inexpensive way to include testing as part of the development cycle. You'll find scores of recipes for testing web applications, from relatively simple solutions to complex ones that combine several solutions. This practical book focuses on how to test web applications -- not what web security consists of or why developers should test. And, rather than IT security, the recipes address application software exclusively -- source code, business logic -- written, operated, and now tested by you. Each recipe in the book states the problem to be solved, the tools and techniques required, technical details involved, and examples. Web Security Testing Cookbook also leverages free tools, and not only because they save you considerable expense. In security, perhaps more than in any other specialized discipline, the best tools tend to be free. The book offers recipes in four different sections to help you: Learn basics concepts to develop tests, and obtain and set up the tools you'll use Automate tools and scripts to test a web application in a systematic way Learn methods to bypass client side input validation for various purposes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and manipulating hidden form fields Focus on the session by finding identifiers, analyzing how predictable they are, and manipulating them with tools By following the recipes in this book, you can be reasonably sure that your application is not going to be one of the thousands that hackers compromiseevery day. They don't take the place of real penetration testing, but they will make sure your application is not a disaster waiting to happen. Take the time to include security testing in the development cycle. Web Security Testing Cookbook will save you weeks of headaches and tons of money down the road. Who knows? This book might even save your job.SynopsisWeb Security Testing Cookbook gives developers and testers the tools they need to make security testing a regular part of their development lifecycle. You'll find recipes related to manual, exploratory testing as well as recipes for automated security testing that you can make part of your regression cycle. The recipes cover the basics like observing messages between clients and servers, to multi-phase tests that script the login and execution of web application features. This book provides developers the techniques they need to consider security in their unit tests. Testers will find a wealth of techniques for building web security test cases and executing them. Web Security Testing Cookbook also leverages free tools, and not only because they save you considerable expense.

Leverage the recipes to add significant security coverage to your testing without adding significant time and cost to your effort.SynopsisAmong the tests you perform on web applications, security testing is perhaps the most important, yet it's often the most neglected. The recipes in the Web Security Testing Cookbook demonstrate how developers and testers can check for the most common web security issues, while conducting unit tests, regression tests, or exploratory tests. Unlike ad hoc security assessments, these recipes are repeatable, concise, and systematic-perfect for integrating into your regular test suite.Recipes cover the basics from observing messages between clients and servers to multi-phase tests that script the login and execution of web application features. By the end of the book, you'll be able to build tests pinpointed at Ajax functions, as well as large multi-step tests for the usual suspects: cross-site scripting and injection attacks. This book helps you:Obtain, install, and configure useful-and free-security testing toolsUnderstand how your application communicates with users, so you can better simulate attacks in your testsChoose from many different methods that simulate common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and manipulating hidden form fieldsMake your tests repeatable by using the scripts and examples in the recipes as starting points for automated testsDon't live in dread of the midnight phone call telling you that your site has been hacked.

We have great news: Head First Algebra is designed for you. Full of engaging stories and practical, real-world explanations, this book will help you learn everything from natural numbers and exponents to solving systems of equations and graphing polynomials.Along the way, you'll go beyond solving hundreds of repetitive problems, and actually use what you learn to make real-life decisions. Does it make sense to buy two years of insurance on a car that depreciates as soon as you drive it off the lot? Can you really afford an XBox 360 and a new iPhone? Learn how to put algebra to work for you, and nail your class exams along the way.Your time is way too valuable to waste struggling with new concepts. Using the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory to craft a multi-sensory learning experience, Head First Algebra uses a visually rich format specifically designed to take advantage of the way your brain really works.SynopsisThis book is algebra with a jolt of fresh air and maybe a whiff of a caffeinated beverage. It's a complete algebra learning experience that engages readers by having them play games, solve puzzles, ponder mysteries, learn the fundamentals of Algebra I that current students are struggling with, or parents have long since forgotten. While readers experience the joy of math, they'll learn (almost without noticing) everything they always wanted to know but were afraid to ask about natural numbers, exponents, graphs and graphing, polynomials, factoring, algebraic fractions, solving equations, the quadratic formula, and much more. Like all of the books in our Head First series, ""Head First Algebra"" uses a visually rich format designed for the way the brain works. Based on the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, this book combines words and pictures in a playful, mixed-media style that not only helps readers understand a subject, but also to remember it.About the AuthorTracey Pilone, a licensed Civil Engineer, is a freelance technical writer who has worked on mission planning and RF analysis software for the Navy.

You saved your buddy's job!; 1.11 To modify an app, you need to dig into the app's architecture; 1.12 The 3 parts of your app: model, view, and controller; 1.13 The 3 types of code are kept in SEPARATE folders; 1.14 The files in the VIEW need to be edited; 1.15 Edit the HTML in the view; 1.16 Sunday, 8 AM; 1.17 The application needs to store more information now; 1.18 A migration is just a Ruby script; 1.19 Rails can generate migrations; 1.20 Give your migration a ""smart"" name, and Rails writes your code for you; 1.21 You need to run your migration with rake; 1.22 But changing the database isn't enough; 1.23 The concert is a sell-out!; 1.24 Tools for your Rails Toolbox; Chapter 2: Beyond Scaffolding: Rails apps, made to order; 2.1 MeBay, Inc. needs your help; 2.2 Scaffolding does WAY too much; 2.3 Let's start by generating the MeBay model...; 2.4 ...and then we'll actually create the table using rake; 2.5 But what about the controller?; 2.6 The view is created with a page template; 2.7 The page template contains HTML; 2.8 A route tells Rails where your web page is; 2.9 Behind the scenes with routes; 2.10 The view doesn't have the data to display app; 2.11 So what should the page show?; 2.12 The controller sends the ad to the view; 2.13 Rails turned the record into an object; 2.14 The data's in memory, and the web page can see it; 2.15 There's a problem -- people can't find the pages they want; 2.16 Routes run in priority order; 2.17 To get data into the view, you will also need code in the controller; 2.18 An index page will need data from ALL of the records; 2.19 Ad.find(:all) reads the whole table at once; 2.20 The data is returned as an object called an array; 2.21 An array is a numbered sequence of objects; 2.22 Read all of the ads with a for loop; 2.23 We need HTML for each element in the array; 2.24 Rails converts page templates into Ruby code; 2.25 Loops can be added to page templates using scriptlets; 2.26 On each pass of the loop, the page generates one link; 2.27 So what does the generated HTML look like?; 2.28 You just got an email from the folks at MeBay...; 2.29 But there are two page templates... should we change the code of each one?; 2.30 But what about the new static content MeBay sent over?; 2.31 Tools for your Rails Toolbox; Chapter 3: Inserting, Updating, and Deleting: Everything changes; 3.1 People want to post new ads online; 3.2 You already know how to build an app that publishes data from the database; 3.3 Saving data works just the OPPOSITE of reading data; 3.4 You need a form to submit data and an action method to save it; 3.5 Are forms and objects related?; 3.6 Rails can create forms that are associated with model objects; 3.7 The @ad form object has not been created; 3.8 The form object needs to be created before the form is displayed; 3.9 The forms ad object will be created in the new action of the controller; 3.10 Each page template now has a matching controller method; 3.11 The form doesn't send an object back, it sends DATA back; 3.12 Rails needs to convert the data into an object before it can be saved; 3.13 The controller create method, step-by-step; 3.14 The controller needs to save the record; 3.15 Don't create a new page, use an existing one; 3.16 But how can a controller action display ANOTHER action's page?; 3.17 Redirects let the controller specify which view is displayed; 3.18 But what if an ad needs to be amended after it's been posted?; 3.19 Updating an ad is just like creating one... only different; 3.20 Instead of creating an ad, you need to find one; instead of saving it, you need to update the ad; 3.21 Restricting access to a function; 3.22 ...but now old ads need to be deleted; 3.23 Doing it yourself gave you the power to do more than scaffolding; 3.24 Tools for your Rails Toolbox; Chapter 4: Database Finders: Truth or consequences?; 4.1 Keep fit with the Rubyville Health Club; 4.2 The application actually looks pretty close...; 4.3 We're going to fix the scaffolding; 4.4 Design the search function; 4.5 Let's start by building the form; 4.6 Add the search to the interface; 4.7 How do we find client records?; 4.8 We only need those records where client-name = the search string; 4.9 There's a finder for every attribute; 4.10 So what's next?; 4.11 We need to match either the client name OR the trainer name; 4.12 We need to be able to modify the conditions used in the SQL query; 4.13 Use :conditions to supply SQL; 4.14 Then there's a knock at the door...; 4.15 Tools for your Rails Toolbox; Chapter 5: Validating your Data: Preventing mistakes; 5.1 Watch out--there's bad data in the room; 5.2 Validation code goes in the MODEL; 5.3 Rails uses validators for simple validation; 5.4 So how do validators work?; 5.5 Let's check if something is a number; 5.6 Users have been leaving out data on their workout forms; 5.7 How do we check for mandatory fields?; 5.8 Validators are simple and work well; 5.9 Something strange has happened at MeBay; 5.10 The validators work, but they don't display errors; 5.11 If you build your own pages, you need to write your own error message code; 5.12 The controller needs to know if there was an error; 5.13 We still need to display error messages!; 5.14 The MeBay system is looking pretty sweet; 5.15 Tools for your Rails Toolbox; Chapter 6: Making Connections: Bringing it all together; 6.1 Coconut Airways need a booking system; 6.2 We need to see flights and seat bookings together; 6.3 Let's look at what the seat scaffolding gives us; 6.4 We need the booking form and seat list on the flight page; 6.5 How can we split a page's content up into separate files?; 6.6 ERb will ASSEMBLE our pages; 6.7 So how do we create the booking form partial?; 6.8 Now we need to include the partial in the template; 6.9 We need to give the partial a seat!; 6.10 You can pass local variables to a partial; 6.11 We also need a partial for the seat list; 6.12 People are ending up on the wrong flights; 6.13 A relationship connects models together; 6.14 But how do we define the relationship?; 6.15 But some people have too much baggage; 6.16 We need to write our OWN validation; 6.17 We need the REVERSE relationship; 6.18 The system's taken off at Coconut Airways; 6.19 Tools for your Rails Toolbox; Chapter 7: Ajax: Avoiding the traffic; 7.1 There's a new offer at Coconut Airways; 7.2 Which parts of a page change most?; 7.3 Doesn't the browser always update the entire page?; 7.4 So what ELSE can make a request?; 7.5 First we need to include the Ajax libraries...; 7.6 ...then we need to add an Ajax ""Refresh"" link; 7.7 The browser needs to ask for an update; 7.8 But SHOULD we make the browser ask over and over again?; 7.9 You listen to a timer like you listen to a button; 7.10 Someone's having trouble with their bachelor party; 7.11 The form needs to make an Ajax request; 7.12 The form needs to be under the CONTROL of JavaScript; 7.13 We need to replace the create method; 7.14 So what effect does this code have?; 7.15 There's a problem with the flight bookings; 7.16 We only know how to update one part of the page at a time; 7.17 The controller needs to return JavaScript instead of HTML; 7.18 So what does Rails generate?; 7.19 If you don't say where to put the response, it will be executed; 7.20 Tools for your Rails Toolbox; Chapter 8: XML and Multiple Representations: It all looks different now...; 8.1 Climbing all over the world; 8.2 The users hate the interface!; 8.3 The data needs to be on a map; 8.4 We need to create a new action; 8.5 The new action seems to work...; 8.6 The new page needs a map... that's the point!; 8.7 So what code do we need?; 8.8 The code will only work for localhost; 8.9 Now we need the map data; 8.10 What do we need to generate?; 8.11 We'll generate XML from the model; 8.12 A model object can generate XML; 8.13 What will the controller code look like; 8.14 Meanwhile, at 20,000 feet...; 8.15 We need to generate XML and HTML; 8.16 XML and HTML are just representations; 8.17 How should we decide which format to use?; 8.18 How does the map page work?; 8.19 The code is ready to go live; 8.20 RSS feeds are just XML; 8.21 We'll create an action called news; 8.22 We have to change the structure of the XML; 8.23 So we'll use a new kind of template: an XML builder; 8.24 Now let's add the feed to the pages; 8.25 On top of the world!; 8.26 Tools for your Rails Toolbox; Chapter 9: REST and Ajax: Taking things further; 9.1 Too many incidents!; 9.2 The map could show more details; 9.3 We can extend the map using Ajax; 9.4 But how do we convert the index page?; 9.5 What will the ""show"" action need to generate?; 9.6 The new map functionality is a success!; 9.7 We need to create requests using Ajax, too; 9.8 The map partial lets us specify a ""new"" action; 9.9 How do we PROVE an incident was saved?; 9.10 The form needs to update the contents of the pop-up's ; 9.11 Avalanche!; 9.12 How things works now...; 9.13 We could have an ""Edit"" link in the pop-up; 9.14 We'll start by modifying the ""edit"" action; 9.15 And we'll also need a new link on the show page; 9.16 So how do we use the link_to helper?; 9.17 Ajax links to the rescue; 9.18 We're using the wrong route!; 9.19 The HTTP method affects the route that's chosen; 9.20 So what's an HTTP method?; 9.21 Head First Climbers needs you!; 9.22 Tools for your Rails Toolbox; Chapter 10: Real-World Applications: Rails in the real world; 10.1 Look! It's a big Ruby ""Try this"" page; 10.2 Web apps need testing too; 10.3 So what kinds of tests are available?; 10.4 Going live; 10.5 So how do you change the database?; 10.6 What's REST?; 10.7 The web application that went astray; 10.8 Living on the Edge; 10.9 Getting more information; 10.10 A little light reading...; 10.11 Head First books on related topics; 10.12 Tools for your Rails Toolbox; 10.13 Leaving town...; 10.14 It's been great having you here in Railsville!; ",429,David Griffiths

$7.95",https://covers.powells.com/9780571225903.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsIn Australian slang, an illywhacker is a country fair con man, an unprincipled seller of fake diamonds and dubious tonics. And Herbert Badgery, the 139-year-old narrator of Peter Carey's uproarious novel, may be the king of them all. Vagabond and charlatan, aviator and car salesman, seducer and patriarch, Badgery is a walking embodiment of the Australian national character--espcially of its proclivity for tall stories and barefaced lies. As Carey follows this charming scoundrel across a continent and a century, he creates a crazy quilt of outlandish encounters, with characters that include a genteel dowager who fends off madness with an electric belt and a ravishing young girl with a dangerous fondness for rooftop trysts. Boldly inventive, irresistibly odd, Illywhacker is further proof that Peter Carey is one of the most enchanting writers at work in any hemisphere.Review""Carey can spin a yarn with the best of them....[A] big, garrulous, funny novel....If you haven't been to Australia, read Illywhacker. It will give you the feel of it like nothing else I know."" The New York Times Book Review Review""A book of awesome breadth, ambition, and downright narrative joy....Illywhacker is a triumph."" Washington Post Book WorldReview""The writing is continuously various and engaging, and always hovering on mockery."" April Bernard, New York Review of BooksReview""[B]ulge[s] with action and fantasy, a picaresque narrative as lively as anything by Saul Bellow, though it also demonstrate[s] what is probably Carey's greatest formal weakness, a tendency toward soufflé in his novels so that the middle of the book sags."" Peter Porter, Times Literary Supplement (U.K.)SynopsisIllywhacker is a dazzling comic narrative, from the lips of the 139-year-old Herbert Badgery, the 'illywhacker' or confidence trickster of the title. Overflowing with magic, jokes and inventions, peopled with aviators, car salesmen, Chinamen and impresarios, Peter Carey's novel is a contemporary classic.About the AuthorPeter Carey received the Booker Prize for Oscar and Lucinda, and again for True History of the Kelly Gang. His other honors include the Commonwealth Prize and the Miles Franklin Award. The author of seven previous novels and a collection of stories, he was born in Australia in 1943 and now lives in New York City.",no page,Peter Carey

So Pearlie Cook begins her indirect, and devastating exploration of the mystery at the heart of every relationship--how we can ever truly know another person. It is 1953 and Pearlie, a dutiful young housewife, finds herself living in the Sunset District in San Francisco, caring not only for her husband's fragile health, but also for her son, who is afflicted with polio. Then, one Saturday morning, a stranger appears on her doorstep, and everything changes.

By failing to seize Gibraltar in the summer of 1940, he lost the war. The Rock of Gibraltar, a pillar of British sea-power since 1704, looked formidable but was extraordinarily vulnerable. Though menaced on all sides by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Vichy France and Francoist Spain, every day Gibraltar had to let thousands of people cross its frontier to work. Among them came spies and saboteurs, eager to blow up its 25 miles of secret tunnels. In 1942, Gibraltar became US General Eisenhower's HQ for the invasion of North Africa, the campaign that led to Allied victory in the Mediterranean. Nicholas Rankin's revelatory new book, whose cast of characters includes Haile Selassie, Anthony Burgess and General Sikorski, sets Gibraltar in the wider context of the struggle against fascism, from Abyssinia through the Spanish Civil War. It also chronicles the end of empire and the rise to independence of the Gibraltarian people.",416,Nicholas Rankin

During her travels, she meets Bruce Lovell, who sweeps the romance-craving Cecily off her feet, marries her, and takes her to his out-of-the-way cottage in the country. However, Lovell is not the charming gentleman he appears to be. Instead, he is a homicidal maniac of the most eerie, repulsive type, and is resolved to murder his new wife, just as he has murdered several other women before her. When a series of circumstances leads Cecily to realise the ghastly fact, she finds herself caught like a rat in a trap, unsure of how she will escape...SynopsisCecily Harrington has led a staid and proper existence. After winning a large amount of money in a sweepstake she desperately yearns for a life of adventure. Enter Bruce Lovell, a handsome and charming stranger who sweeps her off her feet. In a whirlwind romance, she recklessly abandons her job, friends and fianc  to settle in the remote and blissful surroundings of a country cottage.

The match-cutters finally rebel against working conditions in which young girls had their jaws rotted away by phosphorus, and discipline was maintained by a system of crippling fines and sanctions. A grim episode, perhaps, but not many minutes of the play are allowed to pass before the natural ebullience of the traditional Cockney sparrow helps to create sparkling entertainment which warms the heart, yet retains the essential drama of the central theme. The incongruously named ""Hope Court"" is the setting for much of the play, for it is there the workers live in shabby tenements. Desperation turns Kate, the tenement girl, into a reckless strike-leader, and complicates her courtship with Joe, a docker. Annie Besant, the liberal reformer, champions the strikers' cause and plays a vital part in bringing about their ultimate victory over what was then a callous management.",66,Bill Owen

Animal Farm is a fable with a sting. Much has been written about the threat of Communism, but it remained to the late George Orwell, farsighted British author of the brilliant and frightening 1984, to expose the Russian experiment for what it really is; an idealist's dream, converted by realists into a nightmare. In staged dramatic reading version of this timely allegory you will meet beasts whose prototypes have dominated news headlines for many fearful years. Opening on a note of joyous triumph for the creatures who have emancipated themselves from the cruel mastery of a human owner, the reading mounts inexorably to a climax of disillusionment in which the other animals discover themselves now subject to the rule of even more ruthless autocrats: the greedy, cunning pigs. Intermingling humor and drama, Animal Farm wrings the emotions of its listeners, leaving audiences shaken with the tale of a tragedy that happened in a mythical barnyard far away but could happen in our own back yard.",60,Nelson Slade Bond

$14.50",https://covers.powells.com/9780603550607.jpg,"Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsLearning Joy from Dogs Without Collars is about my memories of growing up, being raised by an eccentric and uniquely idealistic single mother. It is about how I was sometimes homeless and lived in shelters and in one apartment after another. It is about adventures my mother and I had, including moving across the country -- from Astoria, Oregon, a small coastal town, to Boston, Massachusetts, a bigger city on a different coast. It is about how I -- by accident, it seemed -- found myself to be the only girl on a high school wrestling team, how that worked out, and what I learned.  The book is also about how I later went to Harvard, a world completely unlike the ones I grew up in; how I adapted to life there. It is about how I met my father when I was nineteen, and how my father finally became my dad.  It is about all of these things, and everything in between. It is the story of a girl coming into her own, learning and understanding her place in the world. It is about the innocence and resiliency of childhood -- the space of happiness and joy which poverty was unable to demolish or diminish.",no page,A A Milne
